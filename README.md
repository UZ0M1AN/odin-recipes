# odin-recipes

## Initial Structure
- I created an index.html file
- I created a folder for my recipes (recipes/)

## Recipe Page
- I created a new HTML file for each of my 3 recipes, indomie.html, chicken-pot-pie.html and kalbi.html.
- I filled the contents in each of them following the pattern:
 + __Title__ of the Recipe
 + An accompanying __image__ of the cooked dish
 + A __description__ following the image
 + __Ingredients__ required to prepare the dish
 + The __steps__ required to prepare the dish
